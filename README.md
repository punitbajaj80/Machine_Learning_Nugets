Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Implementing Machine Learning Algorithms will be easy in the UIPath with the Machine Learning Package. Data Science and Automation is the future as Data Science is more about using scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data. Automated data science would extend beyond this, and could include either the full or partial automation of tasks such as exploratory data analysis
